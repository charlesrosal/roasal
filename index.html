                <p>Hello! I’m Charles F. Rosal, currently studying at the Cebu Institute of Technology – University
                    (CITE). My journey is fueled by the belief that education isn’t just about knowledge, but about
                    using it to create real change. I approach every challenge with determination, knowing that progress
                    is made one step at a time.

                    I’m passionate about learning, growing, and sharing what I’ve gained with others. For me, it’s not
                    just about reaching goals but about enjoying the process and making meaningful connections along the
                    way.</p>
