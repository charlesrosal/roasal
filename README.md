Navigation
The navigation bar at the top of the page allows users to switch between different sections of the portfolio.

Hamburger Menu: On smaller screens (768px and below), the traditional navigation links collapse into a hamburger icon (â˜°). Clicking this icon toggles the visibility of the navigation menu.
Section Display: When you click on a link in the navigation menu (e.g., "Profile," "Education," "Projects"), the corresponding section of the page becomes visible while all other sections are hidden. This creates a single-page application feel where content is dynamically loaded.
Contact Form
The "Contact Us" section features a simple form:

Form Submission: When you fill out the "Name" and "Email" fields and click the "Submit" button, a JavaScript event listener prevents the default form submission (which would typically reload the page). Instead, it triggers an alert message that says "Thank you for reaching out!".
